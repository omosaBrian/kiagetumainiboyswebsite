### History

### 1967 - 71

The management admitted its first batch of students at Sigalagala Technical and Trade School while they awaited completion of Kisumu Technical Secondary School which Former Education Minister the late Dr. Taaitta Toweett officially opened in 1971.

### 1988

In 1988, the Ministry upgraded the institution to a Technical Training Institute, the aim being to produce hands-on human resource, competent in the application of technical skills.
